    <h3>BIKE <img src="biketaxi.jpeg" style="float:right;" width="90px" height="100px"></h3>
    
    <p>The <b>OLA</b> app allows the user to book a ride, after which a rider (called "Captain") arrives at the location. 
        The fare includes a base fare of ₹20 in addition to ₹3 for every kilometer of the ride.<br>
         The "Captains" need to register through the Rapido-Captain app and get validated by submitting the required documents.
         They can use motorcycles, scooters, or e-bikes, but the vehicle cannot be older than 2010.</p>

    <h3>AUTO <img src="auto.JPG" style="float: right;" width="90px" height="100px"></h3>
    
    <p>The auto rickshaw is a common form of transport around the world, both as a vehicle for hire and for private use. They are especially common in countries with tropical or subtropical climates,
         since they usually are not fully enclosed, and are found in many developing countries because they are relatively inexpensive to own and operate.
          There are many different auto rickshaw designs.<br>
         The most common type is characterized by a sheet-metal body or open frame resting on three wheels; a canvas roof with drop-down side curtains. </p>
